# web-app

The goal is to create a web page with a login page that lets you see some graphs and performance of ML models after the correct credentials have been inserted.

**Components:** 

* Run the web-app within a docker container.
* Implement logging system to follow what is happening via terminal.
* Show the map by using shape files (or some other approach) to show current temperature on a map of all European countries by zip code (temperature is updated live or with some lag).
